## tune tricks

#### TABLESAMPLE - get table row count faster

```sql

SELECT 100 * count(*) AS estimate FROM mytable TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1);
-- TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1) is similiar to "select * from foo where random()<0.01".

```

## Materialized views

Use materialized views cautiously
If you’re not familiar with materialized view they’re a query that has been actually created as a table. So it’s a materialized or basically snapshotted version of some query or “view”. In their initial version materialized versions, which were long requested in Postgres, were entirely unusuable because when you it was a locking transaction which could hold up other reads and acticities avainst that view.
They’ve since gotten much better, but there’s no tooling for refreshing them out of the box. This means you have to setup some scheduler job or cron job to regularly refresh your materialized views. If you’re building some reporting or BI app you may undoubtedly need them, but their usability could still be advanced so that Postgres knew how to more automatically refresh them.


## A simpler method for pivot tables

Table_func is often referenced as the way to compute a pivot table in Postgres. Sadly though it’s pretty difficult to use, and the more basic method would be to just do it with raw SQL. This will get much better with Postgres 9.5, but until then something where you sum up each condition where it’s true or false and then totals is much simpler to reason about:


select date,
       sum(case when type = 'OSX' then val end) as osx,
       sum(case when type = 'Windows' then val end) as windows,
       sum(case when type = 'Linux' then val end) as linux
from daily_visits_per_os
group by date
order by date
limit 4;
